## SPECIALIZATION IN ANALYTICS AND DATA SCIENCE
I completed a 2-year Specialization in Analytics and Data Science program, where I learned the fundamentals of data science and developed a strong foundation in mathematics. Throughout the program, I completed several projects that involved data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling. I became proficient in using essential Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and Keras. This program equipped me with the skills to analyze data, derive insights, and create data-driven solutions.
